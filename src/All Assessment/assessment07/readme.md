Interview Questions
Ul coding question: print a navigation menu with categories and children using your framework of choice. You will need a recursive
solution. How would you highlight only the "active" item and expand only the path that contains the active item.
JS question: implement a JS solution for fetching/reading feature flags from an API. How would you improve performance, caching, share
across different apps,...
Systems design: jira active sprint board, what components would you use, how would you optimize the FE loading of thousands/millions
of jira tickets, how would you measure performance.
Advice for the company: although the process is great, I don't think it's great for a full-stack developer. Also, I felt I was not explicitly
asked or guided around some things I was expected to talk about but apparently I didn't.
Advice to candidates: a lot of emphasis around not just giving a solution but presenting alternatives with pros and cons. Speak your mind.
